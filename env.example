# Environment variables for XPass Token deployment on BSC

# REQUIRED: Multi-Sig address for TimelockController roles
# This should be your Multi-Sig wallet address (e.g., Gnosis Safe on BSC)
MULTISIG_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# OPTIONAL: Timelock delay in seconds (IGNORED on mainnet for security)
# Default: 172800 (48 hours) for production
# NOTE: Mainnet (BSC Chain ID 56) ALWAYS uses 48 hours regardless of this setting
# Testnet examples:
# TIMELOCK_DELAY=60        # 1 minute (for quick testing)
# TIMELOCK_DELAY=300       # 5 minutes (for testnet)
# TIMELOCK_DELAY=3600      # 1 hour (for testnet)
# TIMELOCK_DELAY=172800    # 48 hours (for production - same as mainnet)

# REQUIRED: Private key for deployment (without 0x prefix)
